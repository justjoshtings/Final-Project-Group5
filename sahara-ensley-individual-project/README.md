## Files

**Code:**
All individual code written for testing or drafting before integrating into the final project.

----*EDA.py* - This is a script to load data from kaggle into a Data folder. Make sure when you run this script you
are running it in a location with enough space to house the data. It also runs a loop that generates the
'images_summary.csv' file in this folder. It contains pixle counts by category.

----*EDA_figures* - This is a jupyter notebook with basic EDA figures, almost all are based on the 'images_summary.csv'
file.


**Individual-Final-Project-Report:**

This will eventually be the final project report.
